Console/terminal grade evaluation system for a section of 20 students.


We need to manage your grades as a group, we need to input your name and your evaluation result (one number from 0 to 10). Use text files as a database. 
Statistical module of grades obtained will be required. 
It is not necessary to use OOP, but we need a good structure of the application. 
We will need to see your top-down design as well.


Present statistics on screen and at the end of the file.


Statistics: min, max, avg (promedio), most repeated, less repeated.


 (Criteria: best practices = 3, optimal solution = 7)
